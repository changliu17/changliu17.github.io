          <p>In this project, I try to improve the information architecture of a photo-sharing social networking APP called Lofter. I compared competitors and use card sorting to learn from users. This is one of the projects I finished when I took a UX design online course in the summer of 2019. Research on every APP mentioned in this project is based on their version at that time.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h1 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h1><p>Lofter is a photo-sharing social networking APP owned by Netease. Its users’ objective is to share photos and appreciate photos posted by other users so that they can build social connections. Therefore, 5 elements are extremely important to this kind of products:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Home page</strong>: for users to browse photos posted by people they follow</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Discove</strong>r: for users to browse photos posted by other people, offering them a chance to meet new friends</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Me</strong>: for users to manage their posts and account</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Message</strong>: for users to chat with their followers and other users</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Post</strong>: for users to post the photo they want to share</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Competitor-analysis"><a href="#Competitor-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Competitor analysis"></a>Competitor analysis</h1><p>I picked three products to compare their information architecture with Lofter’s. Since Lofter is a product that mainly serves Chinese users, I picked two Chinese APP: Nice and IN. Instagram is the top product in the photo-sharing social networking APP, so it is important to analyze it.</p>
<h2 id="Information-architecture-tree-analysis"><a href="#Information-architecture-tree-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Information architecture tree analysis"></a>Information architecture tree analysis</h2><p>I extracted the information architecture from these 4 APPs and draw the tree structure. Numbers on each level of the structure indicate the importance of each function. Functions with ① is more important than functions with ②. In this way, I can easily compare the structure and find what’s common in those structures and what’s different.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/01/10/S7LPqGD3jXHEw9s.png" alt="trees.png"></p>
<p><strong>First-level Structure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common</strong>: The key objective of the photo-sharing social networking APP is related to “Post” and “Discover” pages. These two functions are included in all 4 APPs. Also，the ”My“ page exists in all 4 APPs as the major account management entrance.</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong>: IN only has three parts in the first-level navigation bar. It combines the home page with “Discover”. Users can reach “Message” from both “Discover” and “My”. Both Lofter, Nice, and Instagram all have 5 parts in the first-level navigation bar. Lofter and Nice chose to add their shopping function in the first-level navigator, while Instagram chose to add “Message”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discover page</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common</strong>: There are 3 functions included by all 4 APPs on their Discover page: recommendation, tags, and search. It is reasonable to think these 3 functions are the core functions of the discovery page.</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong>: IN put “Content posted by following users” and “Massage” under the Discover page. Users may confuse since these two functions not directly related to “Discover”. Instagram put the entrance to scan others’ name tag under the “Discover”, make the entrance not easy to find.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post page:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common</strong>: Posting content is a very mature process. All 4 APPs have the same process.Choose from Library/ Take photos - Edit -post</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong>: These 4 APPs have different post content variety. Instagram focuses on photos and short videos while NIce has live streaming. Lofter encourages interaction based on common interest, so it supports different types of sharing, which includes pictures, music, words, and video.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Home Page</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common</strong>: The main function is to show users what they want to see: the contents posted by people they are following. Also, users can comment, like, re-post and interact with everyone who shares opinions of the post.</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong>: Nice only has Recommendation and Content posted by following users on the home page, which is simple and clear to users. Lofter has “add following users” on the home page, giving users more opportunities to get in touch with others. Instagram put stories on the upper side of the home page so users will browse it more. Also, Instagram has an entrance to the message page on its home page, allowing users to reach their friends quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common</strong>: All 4 APPs have personal statistics entrance on this page. Contents posted by this user are also displayed on this page. Some functions that users do not use very frequently and do not belong to other modules are all collected together, leaving an entrance on this page.</li>
<li><strong>Difference</strong>: IN and lofter have message entrance on this page. Nice leaves find friends and live stream entrances here to give more exposure to these two functions. Instagram has a neat design on this page, focusing on photos and videos related to this particular user. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Findings</strong>：</p>
<ul>
<li>“Post”, “Discover”, and “My” are the common first-level structures </li>
<li>Structures of “Discover” and “Post” are very similar in different APPs, which indicate that users and developers are familiar with this structure.</li>
<li>It is normal to have five tabs on the navigation bar. One of them can be used to show the unique function of this product.</li>
<li>For functions the company wants to encourage users to try, designers can put an entrance on the home page.</li>
<li>Besides the statistics of the user, the main content of the “My” page can display content posted by this user or messages or other functions, depending on the design object.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="User-research"><a href="#User-research" class="headerlink" title="User research"></a>User research</h1><p>Users are people to judge if this improvement is successful. Card sorting is often used to evaluate information architecture. In this project, I use it to understand users’ habits and find the weakness in the current Lofter information architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/01/10/UgqYThaLlmHNd35.png" alt="cardsorting.png"></p>
<p>Following are two of ten tree maps I drew to display users’ sorting plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/01/10/keov3ydSahGJNQF.png" alt="users.png"></p>
<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Users have a mutual understanding of what belongs “Post” and “Personal”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lofter’s “Market” module can be recognized and separated from content sharing by users</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users do not have a common sense on the place of messages and notifications</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some users were confused by tags and categories in “discover”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="Improvement-of-the-information-architecture"><a href="#Improvement-of-the-information-architecture" class="headerlink" title="Improvement of the information architecture"></a>Improvement of the information architecture</h1><p>Combining findings from the competitor analysis and card sorting, I conclude some key points for this improvement and designed a new information architecture for Lofter (Numbers on each level of the structure indicate the importance of each function. Functions with ① is more important than functions with ②).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Delete Check all tags by category. Having 2 sets of standards to classify contents is not bad, but showing these standards to users at the same time might confuse them. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Directly show popular updates in tags the user subscribed to. This can improve the accessibility of the tag subscription function. In the present edition, users need to choose a tag from the subscribed tag list to see updates in the tag. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Transform the subscribed tag list to a slide tab bar on the top of the subscription page. Also, add two tabs: “new” and “popular”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Display the message list on the “My” page and hide functions that requested by users frequently into a drawer menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Combine all kinds of user recommendations into one and give recommendation reasons for the recommendation module.</p>
</li>
</ul>
